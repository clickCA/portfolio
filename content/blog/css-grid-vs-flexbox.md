Modern CSS layouts are primarily built using two powerful systems: CSS Grid and Flexbox. Understanding when to use each can dramatically improve your development workflow and the quality of your layouts.

## Understanding the Fundamental Difference

The core distinction between these layout systems is dimensional:

- **Flexbox** is one-dimensional, dealing with either rows OR columns
- **CSS Grid** is two-dimensional, handling rows AND columns simultaneously

This fundamental difference should guide your choice between the two systems.

## When to Use Flexbox

Flexbox excels at these scenarios:

### 1. Navigation Menus and Toolbars

For horizontal navigation bars where items need to be evenly spaced or aligned:

```css
.nav {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### 2. Centering Elements

The classic centering problem becomes trivial with flexbox:

```css
.center-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100%;
}
```

### 3. Equal-Height Elements

When you need columns or cards to have the same height regardless of content:

```css
.card-container {
  display: flex;
  gap: 20px;
}

.card {
  flex: 1;
}
```

## When to Use CSS Grid

CSS Grid is the better choice for:

### 1. Page-Level Layouts

For defining the overall structure of a page with header, footer, sidebar, and main content:

```css
.page-layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header"
    "sidebar main"
    "footer footer";
  grid-template-columns: 250px 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

### 2. Image Galleries or Card Layouts

When you need items to align both horizontally and vertically in a grid:

```css
.gallery {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  gap: 16px;
}
```

### 3. Complex, Asymmetrical Layouts

When some elements need to span multiple rows or columns:

```css
.dashboard {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto);
  gap: 16px;
}

.feature-card {
  grid-column: span 2;
  grid-row: span 2;
}
```

## Combining Both for Maximum Power

In many modern layouts, the most effective approach is to use Grid for the overall page structure and Flexbox for component-level alignment:

```css
.page {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr minmax(auto, 1200px) 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
}

.card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.card-footer {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  margin-top: auto;
}
```

By understanding the strengths of each system, you can build more maintainable and responsive layouts with cleaner, more semantic CSS.
